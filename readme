This code calculates all parts of the cross section for 
e^- e^+ -> tau^- tau^+  at NLO QED.
When launched in the console the executable "eetautau" located in "./bin" will
calculate the part specified by performing the respective MC integral
(using VEGAS):

I. LO contribution is called by:

	"eetautau (b)orn"

II. NLO real contribution is called by:

	"eetautau (r)ealCor"

III. NLO virtual contribution (using QCDLoop for scalar integrals) is called by:

	"eetautau (v)irtCor"

IV. Integrated dipole contribution is called by:

	"eetautau (i)ntDip"

The results are stored with according names in "./bin/out".
They include histograms with errors (standard deviation) and the final result
of the MC integral

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$	CONSISTENCY		$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Multiple checks of consistency of the programs functions contained in 
"./ext/checks.cc" can be performed.
They include:

	- checks of (squared) matrix elements (using MadGraph for reference),
	- checks of phase space generators,
	- checks of numeric stability (using a singularity generator by M. Schulze),
	- checks of QCDLoop implementation.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$	INPUT PARAMETERS		$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

the input analytics support setting of the two parameters alpha and mu.
Setting values for both in the same call is not supported

I: setting of the alpha phase space cuts for the dipoles:

	"eetautau intDip aII x" -> sets  alpha_II = 10^-x where x is any integer preferably
				   between 0 and 5


II: setting of the renormalization scale:

	"eetautau intDip mu x y " -> sets  mu = x*y where x is any integer and y one of the 
				     following physical parameters: 
						me, mmu, mtau, Etot(10.583GeV), MW, MZ



The physical input parameters are set in the head.h file.
